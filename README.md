# So Many Characters!

![User flow example](public/demo.gif "User flow example")

## Overview

This Vue.js application allows users to analyze text input, providing information about the character count, character count excluding spaces, and word count. The user interface is designed for simplicity and ease of use.

## Context 

If you frequently handle textual content, monitoring its length is important. In marketing, adhering to specified character limits in SMS advertisements is crucial to prevent unnecessary costs. And if you oversee a team of content creators and compensate them based on character count, estimating their workload becomes a routine necessity.

While Google Docs offers a word count feature, the process involves multiple steps: logging in, creating a document, pasting the text, and then utilizing the word count function.

Having followed this method for almost 15 years, I, as a web developer, have the liberty to craft more efficient tools. I've designed an app named 'So Many Characters,' dedicated exclusively to character and word counting. Visit [somany.ch](https://www.somany.ch) on your computer, paste text of any size, and promptly acquire precise character and word counts.

Developed with Vue.js and hosted on Netlify, 'So Many Characters' strives to simplify this essential task for users, offering a swift and hassle-free solution for evaluating text length.
